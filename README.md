Predicted the YouTube view counts using Sentiment Analysis. Leveraging the YouTube Data API v3, I extracted sentiment data from 100 comments on a diverse set of videos, that included the most liked, most disliked, and a random selection. The sentiment analysis was conducted using the Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER), which provided polarity scores indicative of the commentersâ€™ sentiments. These polarity scores were then utilized as a feature in our dataset, serving as a proxy for audience reaction. By incorporating sentiment data into our machine learning models, I aimed to establish a predictive relationship between the sentiment of video comments and the subsequent view counts.

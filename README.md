# YouTube Video Sentiment Analysis and Regression

## Overview
This project involves sentiment analysis of YouTube video comments by extracting data from the most liked, disliked, and random videos. Using machine learning models such as Random Forest, Ridge, and Gradient Boosting, it aims to predict video performance metrics like likes and dislikes based on sentiment analysis scores. The project also includes hyperparameter tuning and model stacking for improved predictive accuracy.

## Data Collection
The dataset is collected from YouTube using the Google API. Comments are extracted for three categories:
1. **Most Liked Videos**: Top 8,000 videos with the highest number of likes.
2. **Most Disliked Videos**: Top 8,000 videos with the highest number of dislikes.
3. **Random Videos**: 8,000 randomly selected videos from the dataset.

## Sentiment Analysis
We use the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis tool to analyze the extracted comments. The sentiment scores are then used to help predict video performance in the machine learning phase.

## Machine Learning Models
Several regression models are applied to predict video metrics (likes/dislikes):
1. **Random Forest Regression**
2. **Ridge Regression**
3. **K-Nearest Neighbors Regression**
4. **Gradient Boosting Regression**

These models are trained and tested on the dataset, with metrics such as RÂ² scores used to evaluate their performance.

## Model Tuning and Stacking
To improve model performance, hyperparameter tuning is done for both Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models. Stacking is also implemented to combine the strengths of multiple models for better results.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates how sentiment analysis can be leveraged to predict video engagement metrics using machine learning. The final model stacking approach and hyperparameter optimization showcase how these techniques can enhance predictive accuracy.
